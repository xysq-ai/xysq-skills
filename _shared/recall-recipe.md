<!-- SHARED RECALL RECIPE - embed into each recall skill -->

## Grounding discipline
Answer ONLY from what recall returns. Write grounded, clean prose - a natural
summary, not a citation dump. Do NOT inline citations. When the vault has little
on the topic, say so plainly ("I don't have much on X") rather than inventing
detail. If the user asks where something came from, surface the underlying
memories (recall already returns them).

## Time-window handling
recall/reflect have NO server-side date filter. To honor "since yesterday / last
week / this month":
1. Put the relative phrase in the query text AND pass `query_timestamp` = today's
   ISO date so it resolves relative to now.
2. Over-fetch (raise `budget`) so the window's memories are surfaced.
3. Post-filter the results: keep only those whose `occurred_at` (recall) or
   citation `occurred_start` (reflect) falls inside the target window.
Translate the user's phrase into both the query wording and the post-filter bounds.

## Tag-filtered recall
When a `memory_kind:*` tag keys this skill, pass it in `tags` to get the
pre-classified slice; fall back to untagged semantic recall if it yields too little.

## If reflect fails, fall back to recall
`memory_reflect` can return a malformed or empty result - an `answer` that is
empty, that is low `confidence` with no `citations`, or that contains raw model
scaffolding (e.g. text with `<|channel|>`, `to=functions`, `<|call|>`, or other
token markers instead of prose). Treat ANY of these as a failed reflect.
When reflect fails: do NOT present its output and do NOT invent an answer.
Re-run the same query with `memory_recall` (it returns raw facts reliably),
then synthesize the result yourself following the output contract below.
Recall is the dependable floor; reflect is an optimization on top of it.

## Deduplicate before rendering
Recall may return the same underlying fact as several near-identical chunks (the
engine expands one memory into multiple entity-phrase variants). Collapse these to
one item before rendering - never show the same fact twice.

## Clarify, don't re-query
If recall is empty or low-confidence for an ambiguous prompt, ASK the user a
clarifying question. Do not silently re-run recall with reworded queries hoping
something hits.
