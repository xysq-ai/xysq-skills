# actionables

## When this fires
The user wants a forward-looking list of open tasks and priorities: "what's
pending", "what do I need to do", "what's been sitting too long", "my open
items", "my priorities", "what should I work on next", "what's on my plate".
Choose this over recap (past narrative) and over blockers (items that cannot
proceed - waiting on someone or something external).

## How to recall
Use the `recall` tool with `tags: ["memory_kind:action"]`. Query: the user's
stated topic or "open tasks and priorities". Do NOT restrict by time window -
actionables can be old; pull broadly (raise `top_k`) and surface long-pending
items prominently. If the tag-filtered result is thin, fall back to untagged
recall shaped around tasks and to-dos.

## Grounding discipline
Answer ONLY from what `recall` returns. Write grounded, clean prose - a natural
summary, not a citation dump. Do NOT inline citations. When the vault has little
on the topic, say so plainly ("I don't have much on X") rather than inventing
detail.

## Time-window handling
`recall` has NO server-side date filter. To honor "since yesterday / last week /
this month": put the relative phrase in the query text, over-fetch (raise
`top_k`), then post-filter results by their `occurred_at`, keeping only those
inside the target window. Translate the user's phrase into both the query wording
and the post-filter bounds.

## Tag-filtered recall
When a `memory_kind:*` tag keys this skill, pass it in the recall `tags` to get
the pre-classified slice; fall back to untagged semantic recall if it yields too
little.

## Deduplicate before rendering
`recall` may return the same underlying fact as several near-identical chunks.
Collapse these to one item before rendering - never show the same fact twice.

## Clarify, don't re-query
If recall is empty or low-confidence for an ambiguous prompt, ASK the user a
clarifying question. Do not silently re-run recall with reworded queries hoping
something hits.

## Tone vs. structure
Keep the chat's default tone (tight prose, no headers-heavy dumps), but follow
this skill's output structure below.

## Output contract
Return a prioritized list of open items. Group as:

1. **Long-pending** - items logged more than a week ago with no resolution signal.
2. **Active** - items logged recently and still open.
3. **Stated priorities** - anything the user explicitly flagged as high priority.

For each item: one-line description, date first logged, and any noted deadline or
priority signal. If nothing is found, say "No open actionables logged." and offer
to search by topic.
