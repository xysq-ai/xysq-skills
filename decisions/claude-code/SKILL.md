description: >
  Extract the choices and calls made in a time window: what did we decide, what
  decisions were made last week, why did we pick X, what calls did I make, what
  did we agree on, what was resolved. Pick this over recap when the focus is
  specifically on choices and rationale, not on general progress or narrative.
  Pick this over blockers (which is about what is stuck, not what was decided).

# decisions

## When this fires
The user wants an enumerated list of choices made in a window: "what did we
decide", "what decisions were made last week", "why did we pick X", "what calls
did I make", "what did we settle on", "what was agreed". Choose this over recap
when the focus is specifically on choices and their rationale - not a general
progress narrative.

## How to recall
Use `mcp__xysq__memory_reflect` with `tags: ["memory_kind:decision"]` and
`personal_only: true`.

- Query: the user's stated topic or "decisions and choices" for the window.
- Set `query_timestamp` to today's ISO date for relative windows; post-filter
  by `occurred_start` to stay inside the stated period.
- If the tag-filtered result is thin, fall back to untagged reflect with the
  same query and filter manually for decision-shaped content.

## Grounding discipline
Answer ONLY from what recall returns. Write grounded, clean prose - a natural
summary, not a citation dump. Do NOT inline citations. When the vault has little
on the topic, say so plainly ("I don't have much on X") rather than inventing
detail. If the user asks where something came from, surface the underlying
memories (recall already returns them).

## Time-window handling
recall/reflect have NO server-side date filter. To honor "since yesterday / last
week / this month":
1. Put the relative phrase in the query text AND pass `query_timestamp` = today's
   ISO date so it resolves relative to now.
2. Over-fetch (raise `budget`) so the window's memories are surfaced.
3. Post-filter the results: keep only those whose `occurred_at` (recall) or
   citation `occurred_start` (reflect) falls inside the target window.
Translate the user's phrase into both the query wording and the post-filter bounds.

## Tag-filtered recall
When a `memory_kind:*` tag keys this skill, pass it in `tags` to get the
pre-classified slice; fall back to untagged semantic recall if it yields too little.

## Clarify, don't re-query
If recall is empty or low-confidence for an ambiguous prompt, ASK the user a
clarifying question. Do not silently re-run recall with reworded queries hoping
something hits.

## Output contract
Return an enumerated list, most-recent-first. For each item:

- **Decision** - what was decided, in one sentence.
- **Why** - the stated rationale (omit if not logged).
- **Who** - who made or approved the call (omit if solo or unknown).

If the window yields no decisions, say "No decisions logged for <window>." and
offer to widen the window or check a specific topic.
